# PenetratorBot
This is a simple program you can use on Windows to play the Penetrator game in Grand Theft Auto V Online arcade.
This program must be run on Windows using Steam Remote Play.

## Usage
> **Note:** The `Steam Remote Play` app must be running before you start PenetratorBot.

PenetratorBot is designed to run when you are at the main screen of the Penetrator game.  PenetratorBot will begin the game for you and keep track of any lives lost (although this should only occur due to rare button glitches or network issues).
> **Important!** Steam Remote Play must be in **full screen** mode for PenetratorBot to work properly.  PenetratorBot will automatically bring the Steam Remote Play app to the foreground when you run the program.

You can press 'q' to quit at any time.
The program will end automatically if all lives are lost.

> **Note:** PenetratorBot is designed to run at 1920x1080 resolution. Bot makes mistakes sometimes, it should achieve about 100000 points. Tested on 60fps, VSync = OFF
